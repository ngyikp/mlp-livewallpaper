This is a fork of the [My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Android Live Wallpaper](https://code.google.com/archive/p/mlp-livewallpaper/) by [@OV3RK1LL](https://twitter.com/OV3RK1LL), cleaned up and usable once again!

Only tested on a Nexus 5X on Android 7.0, your mileage may vary!

Differences from the original source:

* Converted to Android Studio project structure
* Set the compile SDK version to 24 (Nougat)
* Changed the assets download link to GitHub Pages so the ponies actually work!
* Removed AdMob
* Removed "Report a problem" functionality
* Lots of code reformatted

There are still many issues such as ponies randomly flickering and the user interface looking visually outdated. Pull requests to enhance this app would be welcome!
